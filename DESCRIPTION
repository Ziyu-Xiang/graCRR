Description: Provides methods for estimation and inference in high-dimensional linear models using graph-assisted convoluted rank regression (CRR). The package implements a Forward and Backward Stagewise (Fabs) algorithm with lasso and Laplacian penalties, supports EBIC-based selection of the Laplacian penalty, and provides debiased estimators and multiplier bootstrap confidence intervals.
